== Problem facing ==
i) stuck at tests but passed as individually up to #17. was later informed "file descriptor left open" should be solve.

ii) went to the TA, he said my struct args is weirred, it's inside mr yet one of the argument in args points to mr. Fixed it, then stucked at #6 (seg fault) 

ii) a classmate outside professor's office show me how to use gdb instead of valgrind. He helped me fixed args. Now it's not in mr anymore. 

iii) then, stuck at 12, asked other classmates about how to solve address problem since the tests are passed when alone. 
	(solving for file descriptor left open)
     added the function setsockopt to solve it, but still couldn't fix it.
	went on completing the consume and reduce function instead, end up stucking at #7

iii) then, went into infinite loop in #6, gdb said it's about thread_join. After 12 hours, finally realized it's stuck somewhere in reduce/consume. commented out all locks since I don't see any point of keeping them (they're in different client anyway) move to #11.

iV) between #11 and other problem, too frustrate to fix whatever was wrong, so just pulled out code from P3 and modified it. suddenly, it's at #12
	however, now args a is inside mr again. Realized I stored it there so a->i will also be stored inside mr.

v) still didn't fix the "file descroptor left open" problem. added close() for all sockets if any fail. less file left open

vi)end up storing the file descroptor outside the threads then closing them in finish

vii) realize the loop for closing thread if fail should be j=0;j<=i;j++ instead of j=0;j<i;j++

iiX) stuck at #17 forever, nothing seems wrong with consume, but gdb/ valgrind said so.

iX) read the project description carefully again, realize it should return 0 if fail for consume. So I fixed it.
	after doing so, it suddenly pass all tests.
