About the wordc.c:
Linklist is very complicated to write. C is a strong typed language that many things may possibly go wrong before it can ever compile.
The idea was to just use the search function and solve everthing. The initialization can be done by getting the size of the whole file. As the struct was defined in the main function, it'll be undated everytime it returns. The pointer returned by the search function points to the specific location of the structure, so by modifying it, we are able to modify the declared struct in the main function.


About the wordc.sh:
the shell script is very easy to write in the terminal; however, not the same in the .sh file.
There is nothing about the grammer, just modifying the text then display result.

Comparison:
The shell is more simple to write. However, the input part is hard. It's hard to find a way to input file name into the shell script.
The C is more complicated to write, but there is no problem to take in the valueof the file.
